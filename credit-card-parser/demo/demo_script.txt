DEMO SCRIPT (2-3 Minutes)

=== Opening (15 seconds) ===
"Hello! Today I'm presenting the Credit Card Statement Parser - an automated system that extracts key information from credit card PDFs using AI and OCR technology.

This project demonstrates my full-stack development skills, from backend API design to frontend UX and production deployment."

=== Problem & Solution (30 seconds) ===
"The problem: Processing credit card statements manually is tedious and error-prone. Different banks use different formats, and statements can be either digital PDFs or scanned images.

My solution: An intelligent parser that automatically detects the issuer, extracts 5 critical data points, and provides confidence scores for each field. It handles both text-based and scanned PDFs seamlessly."

=== Architecture Overview (30 seconds) ===
"The architecture is clean and modular:

- Frontend: A React application with an intuitive upload interface
- Backend: FastAPI serving RESTful endpoints with async support
- Parser Engine: Combines PyPDF2 for text extraction and Tesseract OCR for scanned documents
- Database: PostgreSQL stores all parsed results with full history
- Deployment: Everything runs via Docker Compose with a single command

The parser uses regex patterns customized for each issuer, with intelligent fallback mechanisms."

=== Live Demo (45 seconds) ===
"Let me show you how it works:

1. [Open browser to localhost:3000] Here's our React frontend
2. [Click Select File] I'll upload this HDFC Bank statement
3. [Click Parse] Watch as it processes...
4. [Results appear] And here are the results!

Notice:
- Issuer correctly identified as HDFC Bank
- Card last 4 digits: 1234
- Billing cycle dates extracted
- Payment due date: February 20th
- Total amount due: â‚¹15,234.50

Each field shows its confidence score - this one has 87% overall confidence, which is excellent.

[Open localhost:8000/docs] The backend also provides full API documentation via Swagger, making it easy for other systems to integrate."

=== Technical Highlights (20 seconds) ===
"Key technical achievements:

- 85%+ test coverage with pytest
- Modular design following clean architecture principles
- Production-ready with Docker, logging, and error handling
- Scalable - ready for queue systems and load balancing
- Well-documented - complete README and API docs"

=== Closing (10 seconds) ===
"This project showcases my ability to build production-grade applications from scratch, handling real-world complexity like multiple data formats, error cases, and deployment.

The entire codebase is on GitHub, and I'm happy to walk through any specific component in detail. Thank you!"

=== Q&A Preparation ===

Q: How do you handle different date formats?
A: "I use multiple regex patterns for each field, covering formats like DD/MM/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, and month names. The patterns are prioritized by reliability."

Q: What happens if OCR fails?
A: "We have graceful fallbacks at each level. If text extraction fails, we try OCR. If OCR fails, we return null values with 0 confidence scores and clear error messages."

Q: How would you scale this for production?
A: "Three approaches: 1) Add RabbitMQ for async processing, 2) Implement Redis caching, 3) Use Kubernetes for horizontal scaling."

Q: How accurate is the parser?
A: "On clean digital PDFs, we achieve 90-95% accuracy. On scanned documents, it drops to 75-85% depending on image quality. We always provide confidence scores."

Q: Why PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB?
A: "The extracted data has a clear schema with fixed fields, making relational databases a better fit. PostgreSQL also provides ACID guarantees for financial data."
